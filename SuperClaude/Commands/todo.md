# /sc:todo - TODO File Rewriting and Improvement

## Purpose
**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: This command MODIFIES your TODO.md file directly by REWRITING its contents.**

This command performs the following actions:
1. Reads your existing TODO.md file
2. Analyzes and reformats the content for better clarity
3. **WRITES the improved content back to TODO.md, replacing the original**

The command uses project context from CLAUDE.md to enhance task descriptions and make them more actionable for Claude Code. Your TODO.md file will be permanently updated with the new format.

## Usage
```
/sc:todo [--high] [--low] [--structured] [--actionable]
```

## Arguments
- `--high` - Rewrite tasks as high-level strategic items with broader context
- `--low` - Rewrite tasks as detailed, granular action items
- `--structured` - Apply consistent formatting with categories and priorities
- `--actionable` - Make task descriptions more specific and implementable
- `--context` - Add project context from CLAUDE.md to clarify tasks
- `--commands` - Suggest appropriate SuperClaude commands for each task
- `--dry-run` - Preview changes without modifying the file
- `--backup` - Create a backup of TODO.md before rewriting

## Execution Steps (MUST COMPLETE ALL)
1. **READ**: Use Read tool to load TODO.md content
2. **ANALYZE**: Parse tasks and understand their intent
3. **CONTEXT**: Read CLAUDE.md for project-specific context
4. **REFORMAT**: Create improved version with:
   - Clearer task descriptions
   - Consistent formatting
   - Added context where helpful
   - Logical organization
5. **WRITE**: Use Write tool to save reformatted content to TODO.md
   - This REPLACES the original file content
   - The Write operation is MANDATORY (unless --dry-run)
6. **CONFIRM**: Report successful update with:
   - File path: `/path/to/TODO.md`
   - Status: "‚úÖ TODO.md has been rewritten with improved formatting"
   - Line count of new file

## Claude Code Integration & Tool Usage
**REQUIRED TOOLS AND ACTIONS:**
1. **Read Tool**: Load TODO.md and CLAUDE.md files
2. **Write Tool**: MUST use to save reformatted content
   - The Write tool call is MANDATORY
   - Write directly to the TODO.md file path
   - This OVERWRITES the existing file
3. **File Path Handling**:
   - Input: Read from `TODO.md` or specified path
   - Output: Write to SAME file path (overwrite)
4. **Success Confirmation**:
   ```
   ‚úÖ Successfully rewrote TODO.md
   üìÅ File path: /path/to/TODO.md
   üìù New file contains X lines
   ```

**CRITICAL**: The Write tool MUST be called to update the file. Simply displaying reformatted content in the response is NOT sufficient.

## File Rewriting Approaches
- **High Level**: Rewrites tasks as strategic objectives with context
- **Low Level**: Rewrites tasks as specific, actionable steps
- **Structured**: Applies consistent markdown formatting and organization
- **Actionable**: Adds specifics like file paths, function names, and clear outcomes

**Note**: All approaches result in the TODO.md file being updated with the new format.

## Examples

### Basic Usage
```
/sc:todo --actionable
```
**Expected Behavior:**
1. Reads TODO.md
2. Reformats tasks to be more actionable
3. **Writes reformatted content back to TODO.md**
4. Reports: "‚úÖ Successfully rewrote TODO.md"

### Combined Flags
```
/sc:todo --high --structured --context
```
**Expected Behavior:**
1. Reads TODO.md and CLAUDE.md
2. Reformats as high-level tasks with project context
3. **Writes new content to TODO.md (overwrites original)**
4. Confirms file update with path and line count

### Preview Mode (No File Changes)
```
/sc:todo --actionable --dry-run
```
**Expected Behavior:**
1. Shows reformatted content in response
2. **Does NOT write to file**
3. Notes: "Preview mode - no files modified"

## Benefits
- Updates TODO.md file with improved formatting
- Makes tasks more understandable and actionable
- Adds helpful context from project documentation
- Suggests appropriate commands for task execution
- Maintains consistency in task formatting
- Provides a permanently improved TODO.md file

## Important Notes
‚ö†Ô∏è **This command modifies your TODO.md file directly**
- The original content will be replaced
- Use `--dry-run` to preview changes first
- Use `--backup` to save original content
- The file path will be shown after successful update

## EXECUTION REMINDER FOR CLAUDE CODE
When executing this command, you MUST:
1. ‚úÖ Use the Write tool to save reformatted content to TODO.md
2. ‚úÖ Report the file path and confirm the write operation
3. ‚ùå Do NOT just display reformatted content without writing
4. ‚ùå Do NOT forget to call the Write tool

**The primary purpose is to UPDATE the TODO.md file, not just show reformatted content.**
