## 7. Executive Summary & Strategic Outlook

Trump's tariff offensive represents the most significant trade shock to Vietnam since WTO accession. While the negotiated reduction from 46% to 20% demonstrates deal-making success, the 40% transshipment penalty directly targets Vietnam's role in China+1 strategies.

**Key Strategic Implications:**
1. **Economic Model Disruption**: Export-led growth faces fundamental challenge
2. **Geopolitical Realignment**: Vietnam forced to choose between US access and Chinese integration
3. **Regional Fragmentation**: ASEAN unity undermined by bilateral deal-making
4. **Investment Reallocation**: Supply chains reconsidering Vietnam hub status

**Risk Assessment**: **HIGH** - Multiple converging pressures on economy, currency, and political stability

**Opportunity Assessment**: **MEDIUM** - Forced diversification may strengthen long-term resilience

**Timeline**: **6-12 months** for full economic impact, **2-3 years** for structural adjustment
