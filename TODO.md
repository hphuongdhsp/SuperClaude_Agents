Based on codebase, update the @README.md and @CLAUDE.md (we just add some new agents in @SuperClaude/Agents/financial and project-management  `@kols, @reporter, @trump`) to reflect the new agents and their descriptions. Ensure the new agents are included in the list of available agents and that their descriptions are clear and concise.
