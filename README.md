A framework that extends Claude Code with specialized commands, personas, and MCP server integration.

**🌏 Languages**: [English](README.md) | [Tiếng Việt](README_vi.md)

**📢 Status**: This is a fork of the original SuperClaude v3 project. This fork aims to continue development and provide installation from source.

## What is SuperClaude? 🤔

SuperClaude v3 is an advanced framework that transforms Claude Code into a comprehensive AI-driven development platform by adding:

- 🛠️ **17 Specialized Commands** (`/sc:` prefix) - From analysis to implementation, each command is optimized for specific development tasks
- 🤖 **38 Domain-Specific AI Agents** - Expert agents organized by department (Engineering, Design, Marketing, etc.) for rapid 6-day development cycles
- 🎭 **11 Intelligent Personas** - Auto-activated AI personalities that adapt based on context (architect, frontend, backend, security, etc.)
- 🔧 **4 MCP Server Integrations** - External intelligence amplification through Context7 (docs), Sequential (analysis), Magic (UI), and Playwright (testing)
- 🌊 **Wave Orchestration Engine** - Multi-stage execution for complex operations with compound intelligence
- 🧠 **Intelligent Routing System** - Automatic tool selection, persona activation, and execution strategy optimization
- 📋 **Multi-Layer Task Management** - From session tasks to cross-session project management
- ⚡ **Advanced Token Optimization** - Symbol system and compression achieving 30-50% token reduction

This framework represents a paradigm shift in AI-assisted development, enabling rapid prototyping, comprehensive analysis, and production-ready implementations.

## Current Status 📊

✅ **What's Working Well:**
- Installation suite (rewritten from the ground up)
- Core framework with 9 documentation files
- 17 slash commands for various development tasks
- 38 specialized AI agents for domain-specific assistance
- MCP server integration (Context7, Sequential, Magic, Playwright)
- Unified CLI installer for easy setup

⚠️ **Known Issues:**
- This is an initial release - bugs are expected
- Some features may not work perfectly yet
- Documentation is still being improved
- Hooks system was removed (coming back in v4)

- **MCP Suite** - More external tool integrations
- **Better Performance** - Trying to make things faster and less buggy
- **More Personas** - Maybe a few more domain specialists
- **Cross-CLI Support** - Might work with other AI coding assistants

*(No promises on timeline though - we're still figuring v3 out! 😅)*

## Adding Custom Commands 🛠️

### Quick Start
You can extend SuperClaude with your own custom slash commands! Here's how:

1. **Create a markdown file** in `SuperClaude/Commands/custom/`
2. **Add required metadata** (YAML frontmatter)
3. **Run** `SuperClaude install` to register

Example custom command:
```markdown
---
allowed-tools: [Read, Grep, Glob]
description: "Analyze and summarize folder contents"
---

# /sc:mysummary - Custom Folder Analyzer

## Purpose
Provide insights into folder structure and contents.

## Usage
```
/sc:mysummary @folder
```
```

That's it! Your command is now available in Claude Code.

📚 **For detailed instructions**, see:
- [Custom Commands Developer Guide](Docs/custom-commands-guide.md)
- [Command Format Specification](Docs/command-format-specification.md)

## Using /sc:todo Efficiently 📝

The `/sc:todo` command helps reformat your TODO.md file to make it more understandable for Claude Code. Here's how to use it effectively:

### When to Use /sc:todo
- When your TODO.md has unclear or poorly formatted tasks
- Before starting work to organize your task list
- After brainstorming to structure your ideas
- When Claude Code struggles to understand your tasks

### Basic Usage
```bash
# Reformat with default settings
/sc:todo

# Create high-level strategic tasks
/sc:todo --high

# Break down into detailed action items
/sc:todo --low

# Apply structured formatting with clear categories
/sc:todo --structured --actionable
```

### Example Workflow
1. **Write your tasks** in TODO.md (don't worry about formatting)
2. **Run** `/sc:todo --structured --actionable` to reformat
3. **Review** the reformatted tasks
4. **Use** other commands like `/sc:implement` or `/sc:improve` to work on tasks

### Tips for Better Results
- Include context in your original TODO.md (e.g., "implement user auth" → "implement JWT-based user authentication for the REST API")
- Group related tasks together
- Use `/sc:todo --commands` to get command suggestions for each task
- Combine flags for best results: `/sc:todo --low --actionable --commands`

## Configuration ⚙️

After installation, you can customize SuperClaude by editing:
- `~/.claude/settings.json` - Main configuration
- `~/.claude/*.md` - Framework behavior files

Most users probably won't need to change anything - it usually works okay out of the box. 🎛️

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### Most Common Commands
```bash
# Understand code
/sc:analyze @src/module --think

# Implement features
/sc:implement "user authentication" --type feature

# Improve code quality
/sc:improve @src/api --focus performance

# Run tests
/sc:test unit --coverage

# Generate documentation
/sc:document @src --structured
```

### Power User Combos
```bash
# Full development cycle
/sc:analyze module && /sc:design feature && /sc:implement feature && /sc:test

# Quality improvement loop
/sc:improve codebase --loop --iterations 3

# Complex system analysis
/sc:analyze system --ultrathink --wave-mode auto
```

### Quick Tips
- Let auto-activation choose personas - it's usually right
- Use `--think` for complex problems
- Add `--validate` for production code
- Wave mode auto-activates for complex tasks
- Commands can be chained with `&&`

## Architecture Deep Dive 🏗️

### Core Architectural Principles

1. **Evidence-Based Decision Making**
   - All operations backed by metrics and validation
   - 8-step quality gate validation cycle
   - Comprehensive error handling and recovery

2. **Intelligent Automation**
   - Context-aware persona activation
   - Automatic MCP server selection
   - Dynamic resource optimization
   - Wave orchestration for complex tasks

3. **Modular Component System**
   - Self-contained components with metadata
   - Dependency resolution and validation
   - Hot-swappable personas and servers
   - Extensible command framework

4. **Performance Optimization**
   - 30-50% token reduction through compression
   - Intelligent caching strategies
   - Parallel execution capabilities
   - Resource-aware operation scheduling

### Command Execution Flow

1. **Input Parsing**: `/sc:command` parsed with arguments and flags
2. **Context Analysis**: Orchestrator analyzes complexity and requirements
3. **Resource Allocation**: Personas activated, MCP servers selected
4. **Execution Strategy**: Single, wave, or delegated execution chosen
5. **Quality Validation**: 8-step validation ensures correctness
6. **Result Synthesis**: Outputs formatted and optimized

### Security Model

- **Path Validation**: All file operations use absolute paths
- **Home Directory Restriction**: Installation confined to user space
- **Component Isolation**: Each component runs in isolated context
- **Dependency Verification**: All dependencies validated before execution
